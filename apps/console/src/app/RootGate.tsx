/**
 * RootGate - decides between the onboarding flow and the workspace. Gated by a
 * client flag (`benzo.console.onboarded`) so it's isolated per browser session
 * (no shared-BFF state to pollute), exactly like the consumer wallet's first-run.
 * Onboarding finish applies the draft to the org server-side, sets the flag, and
 * refreshes the store so the Shell boots into the live workspace.
